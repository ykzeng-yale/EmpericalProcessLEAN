# Schur-complement symmetry bridges

This module contains small reusable symmetry consequences for the Chewi
inf-projection Schur-complement lane.  They are kept separate from
`InteriorPoint.lean` so future packets can extend the envelope proof without
forcing the whole interior-point file to re-elaborate for every tiny bridge.

Source-domain Schur-Hessian derivative certificate.  Concrete
inf-projection source instances can state the gradient derivative, Hessian
derivative, and mixed-third pairing once on the original product domain `s`;
selector stationarity transports those hypotheses to the selected graph before
the packaged Schur derivative route is applied.

Third-order selected-envelope certificate from a supplied Schur-Hessian
derivative certificate.  This separates the easy selected-value
first/second-order envelope part from the harder Schur derivative construction:
future exact inf-projection packets can build `BarrierInfProjectionSchurHessDerivativeOn`
once and then reuse this adapter without re-threading the raw Hessian inverse
derivative data.

Source-radius projected local-norm sandwich from the packaged adjoint-square
envelope model, with both projected Hessian positivity and the zero-displacement
case handled internally.  This is the source-facing local-norm transport gate
for the Schur-envelope route: the only remaining analytic inputs are the
concrete derivative data and the source-radius condition `M * ||y - x||_x < 1`.

Source-domain version of the short full-Hessian direct local-norm gate.  It
uses selector stationarity to turn the original-domain gradient and Hessian
derivative hypotheses into the selected-graph data needed by the Schur route,
then applies the direct local-norm consumer.  This route does not require the
selected-value first-order envelope or the literal infimum package.

/--
Source-radius projected local-norm sandwich from the scalar applied-Hessian
path derivative route.  This is useful when the exact source proof naturally
derives the one-dimensional identity
`d/dt <v, H_schur(z_t) v> = liftedThird(z_t, y - x, v)` before constructing a
full operator-valued Schur derivative certificate.

/--
Source-radius projected local-norm sandwich from the scalar applied-Hessian
path derivative route, with the Riccati segment coefficient derived internally.
The only analytic scalar inputs are continuity of the projected Schur Hessian
on the projected domain and the applied-vector derivative/pairing identity.

/--
Source-radius projected local-norm sandwich from the theorem-facing
full-Hessian derivative package.  This is the highest-level source consumer
for the current inf-projection Schur route: the selected-value first and
second derivative data plus the full-Hessian derivative/third-derivative
pairing first build the third-order envelope, and the envelope then supplies
the direct local-norm transport.

/--
Source-domain square-root plus derivative-data wrapper for the direct
projected source-radius local-norm sandwich in Chewi Proposition 13.11(4).
Unlike the literal-envelope endpoint, this short route does not require a
selected-value function or first-order envelope data; it is the right endpoint
when the next consumer only needs Lemma 13.6-style local-norm transport.
