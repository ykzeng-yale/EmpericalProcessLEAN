# Finite-dimensional empirical-process law wrappers

This module records the uniqueness-only finite-dimensional-distribution layer
behind VdV&W Theorem 1.4.8.  It does not state the full weak-convergence
criterion for arbitrary nets; it only gives a law-extensionality wrapper for
measurable process laws.

VdV&W 1.4.8 uniqueness-only layer: a process law is determined by all of its
finite-dimensional distributions.

This is only the law-extensionality component used in the proof of the
textbook weak-convergence criterion.  It is not the full theorem 1.4.8, which
also involves arbitrary nets, separability, asymptotic measurability, tightness,
and weak convergence.

VdV&W 1.4.8 uniqueness-only layer in `IdentDistrib` form: process-level
identical distribution follows from identical distribution of every
finite-dimensional restriction.

This is still only a law-extensionality foundation.  It does not assert the
full weak-convergence/FDD-converse theorem.
